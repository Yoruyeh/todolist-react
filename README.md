## Introduction
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Apart from the todo list page, all the other pages are static.
In the todo list page, you can :
* Enter your todo items in the input box at the top. 
* To add a new item, you can click the "Add" button or press the Enter key. 
* To edit a todo item, simply double-click on it, and press Enter to save the changes, or press Esc to discard them. 
* By clicking on the circle on the left of a todo item, you can toggle between marking it as completed or incomplete.
* You can delete a todo item by clicking the "X" button on the right.
